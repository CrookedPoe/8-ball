# Magic 8 Ball Example

A simple example of a classic Magic 8 Ball console application. The overall intention is to showcase this example application in several different languages as an example for effective learning and teaching. My personal opinion is that it's a great option because it demonstrates many concepts in a simple format. The intention is for each of these versions to reflect each other as closely as I could think of so that they all function exactly the same.
